# Simplified Solana Structure

## Overview
The Solana escrow functionality has been consolidated into a single, easy-to-follow file to reduce complexity and function call chains.

## File Structure

### `src/components/solana/EscrowOperations.tsx`
**Single file containing ALL Solana operations:**

- **Utility Functions:**
  - `hashString()` - Creates SHA-256 hash for apartment/profile IDs
  - `getApartmentEscrowPDA()` - Gets escrow account address
  - `getStakeRecordPDA()` - Gets stake record address

- **Data Fetching:**
  - `fetchData()` - Fetches apartment, escrow, and stake data in one function
  - Direct Supabase calls for apartment data
  - Direct program account fetches for escrow/stakes

- **Operations:**
  - `handleInitialize()` - Initialize apartment escrow
  - `handleStake()` - Create new stake
  - `handleResolve()` - Resolve stake (apartment owner only)
  - `handleSlash()` - Slash stake (apartment owner only)

- **UI:**
  - Complete React component with all UI elements
  - Left column: Escrow status + staking form
  - Right column: Stakes list with owner controls
  - Instructions section

## Key Simplifications

1. **No Hook Chains**: Everything is in one component, no multiple custom hooks calling each other
2. **Direct Operations**: Functions call the Solana program directly, no abstraction layers
3. **Single State**: All state management in one place
4. **Clear Flow**: Easy to follow from user action to blockchain transaction
5. **Consolidated Imports**: All necessary imports in one file

## Usage

```jsx
// In your page
import { EscrowOperations } from '@/components/solana/EscrowOperations';

export default function EscrowPage({ params }) {
  const { apartmentId } = await params;
  return <EscrowOperations apartmentId={apartmentId} />;
}
```

## Removed Files (ALL redundant code eliminated!)
- ❌ `useStakingActions.tsx` - Consolidated into main component
- ❌ `useEscrowData.tsx` - Consolidated into main component  
- ❌ `useApartmentData.tsx` - Consolidated into main component
- ❌ `useSolanaProgram.tsx` - Consolidated into main component
- ❌ `StakingInterface.tsx` - Consolidated into main component
- ❌ `StakeManagement.tsx` - Consolidated into main component
- ❌ `EscrowPage.tsx` - Consolidated into main component
- ❌ `types.ts` - Types moved inline

## Final Result
**ONLY 1 FILE REMAINING:** `src/components/solana/EscrowOperations.tsx`

## Benefits
- **Easier debugging**: All code in one place
- **Less complexity**: No function call chains to trace
- **Better maintainability**: Single source of truth
- **Clearer logic flow**: From user input to blockchain transaction in one file
